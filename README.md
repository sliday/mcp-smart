### üéØ Claude Code Integration with Agent Hooks

To enable automatic Smart advisor access in Claude Code, add this to your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` file (or local project CLAUDE.md). This hooks the MCP server with Claude's agent system:

```markdown
When facing uncertainty and needing advice, you have exclusive access to L7 Google programmer named Smart. Ask him when appropriate using these terms: smart_advisor, code_review, get_advice, expert_opinion, smart_llm. You can specify what you're looking for, these are the modes available:
- auto - GPT-4o-mini intelligently selects the best provider
- intelligence - Routes to Claude Sonnet 4 (ultimate reasoning)
- premium - Routes to OpenAI o3 (high-end reasoning)
- speed - Routes to xAI Grok (fast responses)
- balance - Routes to Google Gemini Flash (cost/performance balance)
- cost - Routes to DeepSeek (budget-friendly)
- all - Multi-provider consultation (all providers)
```

This integration allows Claude Code to automatically consult the Smart advisor when encountering complex coding problems or needing expert opinions.

await smart_advisor({
  model: "auto",
  task: "Optimize this React component for performance",
  context: "Component renders 10,000+ items with complex state"
});
```

### Strategy-Based Routing
```typescript
// Maximum intelligence for complex problems
await smart_advisor({
  model: "intelligence", // Routes to Claude Sonnet 4
  task: "Design a fault-tolerant distributed system architecture",
  context: "Microservices with 99.99% uptime requirement"
});

// Speed-optimized responses
await smart_advisor({
  model: "speed", // Routes to xAI Grok
  task: "Quick debugging help for this JavaScript error",
  context: "TypeError in production, need fast solution"
});

// Cost-effective solutions
await smart_advisor({
  model: "cost", // Routes to DeepSeek
  task: "Write a simple sorting algorithm",
  context: "Basic coding task for learning"
});

// Random provider selection
await smart_advisor({
  model: "random", // Randomly selects from all providers
  task: "Refactor this function for better readability",
  context: "Legacy code that needs modernization"
});
```

### üé≤ Random Mode Benefits

The random routing strategy offers unique advantages:

- **üîç Provider Testing** - Compare different AI approaches to the same problem

- **üéØ Bias Reduction** - Avoid over-reliance on a single provider
- **üöÄ Discovery** - Uncover unexpected solutions from different AI models
- **üîÑ Experimentation** - Perfect for A/B testing AI provider performance

```typescript
// Great for testing different perspectives
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  const result = await smart_advisor({
    model: "random",
    task: "Explain this complex algorithm",
    context: "University-level computer science"
  });
  console.log(`Attempt ${i + 1}: Different AI perspective`);
}
```

### Multi-Advisor Consultation
```typescript
// Get perspectives from all providers
await smart_advisor({
  model: "all",
  task: "Review this security-critical authentication system",
  context: "OAuth2 implementation handling sensitive user data"
});
```

### Direct Provider Access
```typescript
// Use specific provider directly
await smart_advisor({
  model: "claude",
  task: "Ethical considerations for AI system design",
  context: "Building recommendation engine for social media"
});
```
